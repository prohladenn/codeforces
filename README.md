# Codeforces Contests and Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems and contests from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com). I track my progress, contest participation, and problem-solving results.

## Contests Overview

Below is a list of the contests I've participated in, along with links to the contest page and folders with my solutions. For each contest, I also indicate how many problems I solved during the official contest time and after the contest.

## How to Use This Repository

- Each contest has its own folder under `src/prohladenn.vko/`, where you can find solutions for all problems in that contest.
- The structure is organized as:
    - `ProblemA.cpp`, `ProblemB.cpp`, etc., where each file contains the solution for the respective problem.
    - The `_template` folder contains a template for coding new problems.

## Updates
I will keep this repository updated with new contests and solutions regularly as I continue participating in Codeforces contests.
