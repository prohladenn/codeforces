# Codeforces Contests and Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems and contests
from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com). I track my progress, contest participation, and problem-solving results.

## My Codeforces Profile

You can check my Codeforces profile here: [prohladenn_vko](https://codeforces.com/profile/prohladenn_vko)

## Contests Overview

Below is a list of the contests I've participated in, along with links to the contest page and folders with my
solutions. For each contest, I also indicate how many problems I solved during the official contest time and after the
contest.

## How to Use This Repository

- Each contest has its own folder under `src/prohladenn/vko/`, where you can find solutions for all problems in that
  contest.
- The structure is organized as:
    - `ProblemA.java`, `ProblemB.java`, etc., where each file contains the solution for the respective problem.
    - The `_template` folder contains a template for coding new problems.

## Updates

I will keep this repository updated with new contests and solutions regularly as I continue participating in Codeforces
contests.
